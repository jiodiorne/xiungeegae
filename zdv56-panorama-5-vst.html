I spent the weekend having a play with Komplete Start and factory instruments, but there were a couple of things that made me wonder whether it's worth the effort trying to use NI VSTs in Reason. I can use the MIDI Learn function inside Komplete Kontrol running standalone, but inside Reason, it won't respond to my Nektar and it wouldn't learn anything at all. Basic signals like notes and modwheel work, but it was a real pain in practice as I had to override remote mapping to get the encoders. The blooo is a software instrument for Microsoft Windows (VST) and Apple macOS (VST/AU) based on the classic subtractive synthesis architecture.

The scrooo is a polyphonic software synthesizer plug-in for Microsoft Windows (VST) and Apple macOS (VST/AU) based on a spectral formant synthesis architecture and written in native C++ code for high performance. Main features are:Up to 64 voices polyphony including portamentoTwo band-limited carrier oscillatorsThree fully independent formant generator sectionsThree formant generation modesTwo amplifiers with volume and panorama control Download Full Bucket Music The Scrooo v1.2.3 I‘ve been searching around if there is an accurate method to pinpoint a sound effect in the stereo panorama of a video. For example: car in a scene is driving from the left to the right. I am usually automating the panning values for that specific sound to move from left to right in the stereo field. But it is not always accurate enough for me at times. Often I go back and correct it. It would be handy to have some sort of tool that would let me pinpoint an object in the video window of my DAW/A. I'm a Reaper user that records different genres at home. I don't have a lot of room to spare, so I'm looking for something small. I do not have any hardware synths. Maybe in the future. So far, If I deal with Midi, I get by with Clicking things with my mouse\(which when composing, is not really inspiring\), or use pre\-made patterns with things like Addictive Drums 2. I've begun to dabble with virtual synths as of late. The MIDI keyboard market seems to have a lot of options and I can't really. 
I have been torturing myself over switching back to a hardware workstation for playing keys live without having a computer screen on stage. I tried Ableton and Touchable/Lemur/etc. and they have let me down several times forcing me to pull the laptop out to see what scene/preset I was on. With Bitwig/Panorama, save everything, even if it's just one VST, in a container. Use the creator field as a set list. Now you can turn on your computer, load project, and hide the computer. You can browse. Let me preface the collection by saying that I was only at CES for two days, and was attending for an engineering firm. I stopped by many virtual reality booths for my personal pleasure, but was not able to visit experiences that required a significant line (the Oculus booth, for example). This is a collection of images and videos from VR, AR, and other related booths I visited. Enjoy!

( Original post on /r/oculus. This is sort of a cross-post from head-fi, I want to share it with a larger audience. If you've heard any of the binaural samples on Youtube, you know how awesome they can be when the head they used to record matches yours. I've been experimenting with dozens of plugins that claim to replicate same with conventionally-recorded music. Nothing has been satisfying for the majority of material until recently.
