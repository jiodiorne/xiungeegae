I have not been able to as consistently carry a game in any other tank from tiers I through X as I have in my T-34. Why I love this tank so much? I use the 57mm Zis gun. A quick comparison should tell you why the 76mm top gun on the T-34 is a newbie trap which significantly lowers the tank's performance. 57mm Zis4 Alpha: 85 Pen: 112 AP / 189 APCR DPM: 2,217 (250 less than the T-54, except you're in Tier V instead of IX) Reload: 2.3 seconds.

Most of the guides I've read agree on side-scraping, angling and whatnot, but none of them are new. The power creep in guns surely have affected the tank, and how it's playing. Is it advisable to spend 44k free exp to get the top gun, or is there another viable option to grind it out?

I havent played in a while and wanted to get back into the game. I bought premium to ease the grind. I currently would like to reach br 8.3 am currently at 7.0 specifically t44-100.
